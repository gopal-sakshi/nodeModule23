Common JS modules
- `exports` is a reference to `module.exports`
- 1, 2, 3, 4.js ====> all of them deal with exporting CommonJs modules
- using1, test4.js ===> how to use commonJs modules
    by using `require`



Why modules
- abstract code
    to delegate functionality to specialised libraries
    so that we don't have to understand the complexity of their actual implementation
- encapsulate code
    to hide code inside the module if we don't want the code to be changed
- reuse code
    to avoid writing the same code over and over again
- manage dependencies
    to easily change dependencies without rewriting our code
