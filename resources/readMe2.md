In any module, exports is a special object (or)
Every module object, had an exports property


The exports object becomes complete when Node finishes loading the module.
The whole process of requiring/loading a module is synchronous. 
Thatâ€™s why we were able to see the modules fully loaded after one cycle of the event loop.
This also means that we cannot change the exports object asynchronously.
fs.readFile('/etc/passwd', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    exports.data = data;                            // Will not work.
});
